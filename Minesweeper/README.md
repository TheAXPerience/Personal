# Minesweeper

This was just a fun little thing that took me a few days.
The dimensions were based off the dimensions on the version of the game from my phone, just flipped to be prioritized horizontally.
The game was coded in C# in Visual Studio, using the aforementioned program's GUI engine.
Graphics are not my passion, so looks very simplistic.

The game itself can be played by selecting Minesweeper/bin/Release/Minesweeper.exe.
