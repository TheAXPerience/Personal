Things I worked on in my free time

dreamweaver: developed in Java, Eclipse.
  This is a small battle simulator for an RPG idea I made back in 2017. The structure of the file used to store character and attack data was somewhat simple, and there was an attempt to add special effect moves, such as healing or a jump attack (similar to Final Fantasy).

Maxwell: developed in C++, Visual Studio (Windows 10 SDK, 10.1.17763.0).
  This was a remake of dreamweaver that I decided to code in C++ in 2018. The stats and calculations were redone, and effects were removed. This iteration changed the file used to store data into a binary file and added a feature to create your own character and attacks.

Minesweeper: developed in C#, Visual Studio (.NET framework 4, 4.6).
  A quick version of Minesweeper made in 2019.

Tetris: developed in C#, Visual Studio
  A quick version of Tetris made in 2019.

Visual Studio 2017 Community, 15.9.18
